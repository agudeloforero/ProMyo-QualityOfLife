# 🦾 ProMyo – Quality of Life  
**Low-cost Myoelectric Upper Limb Prosthesis Project**

---

## 📘 Overview
**ProMyo – Quality of Life** is an applied research project developed at the **Centro de Electricidad y Automatización Industrial (CEAI)** – SENA, Cali, Colombia.  
The project focuses on the **design and fabrication of a low-cost myoelectric prosthesis** for upper limbs using **digital manufacturing technologies** and **locally available electronic components**.

Our goal is to contribute to improving the **quality of life and autonomy** of people with upper-limb amputations through open-source, reproducible, and accessible technological solutions.

## 🧩 Objectives

### 🎯 General Objective
Design and validate a low-cost myoelectric upper-limb prosthesis prototype, adapted to the patient’s anthropometry and functional requirements, using digital fabrication technologies and local electronic components.

### 🔹 Specific Objectives
1. Analyze the clinical, functional, and ergonomic requirements of the patient to adapt the base design.  
2. Digitally model and adjust the prosthetic components from open-source files and 3D scans of the stumps.  
3. Fabricate and assemble the prosthesis parts using 3D printing, validating mechanical resistance and joint functionality.  
4. Implement and test a myoelectric control system with locally sourced sensors and servomotors.

## 🧠 Background

The development of upper-limb prostheses has advanced significantly through **additive manufacturing** and **open-source design initiatives**, such as **e-NABLE**, which foster global collaboration to provide accessible prosthetic solutions (Ten Kate et al., 2017).  
However, many prosthetic devices are still **economically inaccessible** or **difficult to adapt** to individual anatomical needs.  

By integrating **reverse engineering**, **3D scanning**, and **bio-signal control**, ProMyo seeks to demonstrate a viable, replicable, and sustainable model for prosthetic design in Latin America.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The project follows an **applied research approach** based on **reverse engineering and iterative design**, through the following phases:

1. **Clinical and Functional Analysis** – Patient assessment and ergonomic study.  
2. **Digital Design and Modeling** – Adaptation of the Medallo Bionic Arm model.  
3. **Digital Fabrication** – 3D printing of mechanical components.  
4. **Electronic Integration** – Configuration of EMG sensors (AD8232) and Arduino Nano control.  
5. **Testing and Validation** – Dimensional, ergonomic, and functional evaluation.
